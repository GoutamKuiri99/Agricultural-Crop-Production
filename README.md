# Project Description
Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring food security and sustainable development. In recent years, the agricultural sector has faced numerous challenges including climate change, soil degradation, water scarcity, and fluctuating market demands. To address these challenges, adopting an integrated approach to agricultural crop production is essential. This project aims to develop a comprehensive strategy for sustainable crop production by integrating modern techniques, traditional knowledge, and innovative solutions.

# Problem Statement:
The Agriculture business domain, as a vital part of the overall supply chain, is
expected to highly evolve in the upcoming years via the developments, which are
taking place on the side of the Future Internet. This paper presents a novel
Business-to-Business collaboration platform from the agri-food sector perspective,
which aims to facilitate the collaboration of numerous stakeholders belonging to
associated business domains, in an effective and flexible manner.
This dataset provides a huge amount of information on crop production in India
ranging from several years. Based on the Information the ultimate goal would be to
predict crop production and find important insights highlighting key indicators and
metrics that influence crop production.
Make views and dashboards first and also make a story out of it.
